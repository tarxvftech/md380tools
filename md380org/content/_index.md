# MD380Tools


MD380Tools is a patched firmware distribution for the Tytera MD380.
It adds support for a number of features including promiscuous mode, a
CallerID database, USB logging, and Morse code narration.

This website is intended for users of our firmware patches, while
developers might prefer the source code and developer documentation at
[travisgoodspeed/md380tools](http://github.com/travisgoodspeed/md380tools/)
on Github.  Our patches are written in C, but depend upon blackbox
binaries from the manufacturer and symbol addresses which were
painstakingly reverse engineered.
