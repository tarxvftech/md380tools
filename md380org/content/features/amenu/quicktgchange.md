The [Application Menu](..) includes a way to quickly change the target talkgroup "ad-hoc". It is a temporary change - it will return to the value programmed into the selected channel once you change channels. 

I'm going to enter my ID (not a valid "talkgroup" since it's a user id, but it serves as an example), 3125404. You will use something more like 3 for North America, or 3172 for "Northeast".
Select the "TkGrp" entry with the arrow keys, 
![amenu quickly change talkgroup](amenu_change_tg.bmp)
then press the green button to edit the field.
![amenu quickly change talkgroup](amenu_change_tg_2.bmp)
If you need to enter a shorter ID like here, you can press the red button to delete any digits leftover from the previous talkgroup (necessary if you change from 3100 to 3, for instance).
![amenu quickly change talkgroup](amenu_change_tg_3.bmp)
Then press the green button to confirm the change.
![amenu quickly change talkgroup](amenu_change_tg_4.bmp)
Note the "Cont"act field has a "*" to indicate it's an ad-hoc contact, and temporary.


One of the main benefits to this capability is that codeplugs can be very simple - only having different channels for the most popular or most used talkgroups. All other talkgroups can be set ad-hoc, saving effort and radio memory.
