The Application Menu (abbreviated amenu) is a menu the md380tools developers added, completely separate from the original stock firmware's menu system. 

How to open
-----------
With md380tools firmware, It can currently be opened with the red "back" button.  
In KG5RKI's fork of md380tools, it can be opened with the "#" key.  
You navigate through the menu with the arrow keys, the green button enters submenus, edits fields, and saves values, and the red button serves as a "back" button.

It looks something like this:

You can close it again by pressing again whatever button you pressed to open it.
