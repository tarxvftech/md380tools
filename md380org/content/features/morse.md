DMR opens up a whole new world of digital ham radio, but it can be a
bit awkward to use for hams who are unable to see the screen.

MD380Tools solves this with a narration feature that can be enabled
through the MD380Tools menu.  This narrator will beep station names
and other on-screen items audibly in Morse code so you can know which
Zone or Channel is selected without looking at the screen.


Morse output is off by default but can be "enabled" or even "verbose" using the [Application Menu on the red button](/features/amenu).
Morse output will play the various menu entries using morse code, allowing blind operation of the radio.
Menu entries are read with the label in a lower pitch, and the value in a higher pitch.

Morse off naturally means nothing is "read" aloud to you in morse code.
![morse enabled](/features/amenu/testsetup/morse_enabled.bmp)
Enabled will read menu options and channel numbers.
![morse verbose](/features/amenu/testsetup/morse_verbose.bmp)
Enabled will read menu options and channel names.
![morse volume 100](/features/amenu/testsetup/morse_volume_100.bmp)
You can also change the speed, pitch, and volume of the morse narrator to your liking.
